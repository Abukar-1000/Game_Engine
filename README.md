| Use the ADT developed in class, or create your own                      |<img src="public/checkMark.png" width="25" height="25">           |
| You should have some sort of tool for managing the background and timing|<img src="public/checkMark.png" width="25" height="25">           |
| You should also support some kind of sprites                            |<img src="public/checkMark.png" width="25" height="25">           |

## Logic  &ensp; <img src="public/logic.png" width="25" height="25">
* User clicks the `Start Timer`, the only button on screen.
* This will trigger a state change and cause a loop to begin.
* In the loop:
    * Check if the user has clicked `Stop Timer`
        * If so break loop. 
    * We increment the elapsed seconds.
    * Update the UI.
## Small Nuances & Reflections &ensp; <img src="public/nuance.png" width="25" height="25">
* If the user refreshes the page, the loaded image is lost from the DOM.
    * This was due to the `.hidden` css property previously applied.
* To handle this I:
    * Alter the html content to remove `.hidden` css style when the page <br>
      is refreshed.
    * Re-draw the canvas image after the page has reloaded.
* I was under the impression that HTML, CSS, and JavaScript where the only <br>
  way to add graphics to a UI on the web. Seeing the canvas DOM element definately <br>
  makes me rethink web graphics.
* I also dindn't realize how interconnected math and computer graphics were. This <br>
  assignment required me to refresh some of my algebra, and knowledge of the cartesian <br>
  plane.
* Desmos was really helpful in helping me visualize points on a cartesian plane, with a small <br>
  caviot of inversing the y valuse of each point.
